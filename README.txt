Interactive Infographic README

Overview

This project contains two key interactive visualizations:

Bar Graph - A dynamic bar graph where each bar is hoverable, providing additional details upon hovering.
Chord Diagram - A sophisticated chord diagram with both hoverable contents and interactive nodes. The nodes can be clicked to collapse or expand, allowing for a detailed exploration of the data relationships.

Visualization Details

1. Bar Graph
Hoverable Bars: Each bar in the graph responds to hover actions. When you hover over a bar, additional information related to that bar is displayed, offering more insight into the data it represents.

2. Chord Diagram
Hoverable Contents: The connections between nodes (chords) in the diagram are hoverable. When you hover over a chord, the associated data is highlighted, and additional details are shown, providing a clearer understanding of the relationships.

Clickable and Collapsible Nodes: Nodes in the chord diagram are interactive. You can click on any node to collapse or expand it. This functionality allows you to explore specific sections of the diagram in detail, revealing or hiding connections as needed.
Usage
